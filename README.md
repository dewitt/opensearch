# What is OpenSearch?

OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.

The most recent version of the specification is [OpenSearch 1.1 Draft
6](opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md).

# What is this repository?

This repository is a migration of the opensearch.org website. The raw
export files can be found in the [src/](src/) subdirectory, the extracted 
wiki text can be found in the [mediawiki/](mediawiki/) subdirectory, and
a cached copy of the html can be found on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180421215752/http://www.opensearch.org/Home).

# How do I get involved?

The specification has been unchanged and stable for over a decade, and is unlikely 
to change again. However, if you see a problem or want to suggest a modification,
please [open an issue on the issue tracker](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/issues) or 
[fork the repository and send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
